## 💻 Development Guidelines

### Component Development

When creating a new component:

1. **Use TypeScript** - All components must be written in TypeScript
2. **Follow existing patterns** - Look at existing components for reference
3. **Use Radix UI primitives** when available
4. **Style with Tailwind CSS** - Use utility classes
5. **Ensure accessibility** - Follow WAI-ARIA guidelines
6. **Add proper TypeScript types**
7. **Include JSDoc comments**
8. **Write tests** - Every component needs tests
9. **Update documentation**

Example component structure:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { cva, type VariantProps } from 'class-variance-authority';
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';

const componentVariants = cva(
  'base-classes',
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: 'default-classes',
        secondary: 'secondary-classes',
      },
      size: {
        sm: 'size-sm-classes',
        md: 'size-md-classes',
        lg: 'size-lg-classes',
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: 'default',
      size: 'md',
    },
  }
);

export interface ComponentProps
  extends React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>,
    VariantProps<typeof componentVariants> {
  // Additional props
}

const Component = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, ComponentProps>(
  ({ className, variant, size, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <div
        ref={ref}
        className={cn(componentVariants({ variant, size, className }))}
        {...props}
      />
    );
  }
);

Component.displayName = 'Component';

export { Component, componentVariants };
```
